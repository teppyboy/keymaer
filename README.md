# keymaer

**key ma**pp**er** (because my keyboard has the 0, p, ;, / button broken)

## Installation

Soon, for now you need to run from source (and with sudo in Linux)

### From source

Assuming you have `poetry` installed:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/teppyboy/keymaer
cd keymaer
poetry install
poetry shell
# Linux: sudo python -m keymaer
# Windows: py -m keymaer
python -m keymaer
```
